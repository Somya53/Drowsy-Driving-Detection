# Drowsy-Driving-Detection

This is a drowsy driving detection system that uses a pulse sensor connected to an Arduino board and an AI component based on reinforcement learning to detect when the driver is becoming drowsy.

Overview
The system consists of three main components:

Pulse Sensor: The pulse sensor is connected to an Arduino board and measures the driver's heart rate. This data is transmitted to the AI component.

AI Component: The AI component uses reinforcement learning to learn from the driver's behavior and detect when they are becoming drowsy. When the AI detects drowsiness, it sends an alert to the driver to take a break.

Alert System: The alert system can be customized to suit the driver's preferences, such as an alarm or a vibration.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/drowsy-driving-detection.git
Install the Arduino IDE and open the drowsy-driving-detection.ino file in the IDE.

Connect the pulse sensor to your Arduino board according to the instructions provided with the sensor.

Upload the code to the Arduino board.

Connect the Arduino board to your computer and run the following command to start the system.

Reinforcement Learning
The AI component uses reinforcement learning to detect drowsiness in real-time. The reinforcement learning algorithm is trained on a dataset of driver behavior and can adapt to the driver's individual patterns of behavior.
